A custom-made audio system for Unity that uses FMOD's programmer audio to handle multiple output devices.

WARNING: in its current state, this system is really bad and prone to freezes/crashes. I created it with really bad memory management considerations, which I do intend to fix over time- though the main functionality is present, if unreliable.
