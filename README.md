# anakusis

A custom-made audio system for Unity that uses FMOD's programmer audio to handle multiple output devices.

The repo is currently empty- I am in the process of pulling the system from a project it was integrated into and making it function independently. Because I modified the requirements over the course of the project's development, Anakusis ended up melding into the project rather than existing separately- and as such I need to unmeld it :)

WARNING: in its current state, this system is really bad and prone to freezes/crashes. I created it with really bad memory management considerations, which I do intend to fix over time- though the main functionality is present, if unreliable.
